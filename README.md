# refugee_case_cluster
- getdata:  Extract case numbers and court decision summaries from UCHasting website.
            Case numbers are saved to cases_list1.txt.
            Summaries are saved to summary_list1.txt in the same order.
            This is my first time playing with https request. Feeling so great.
- casecluster:  Data is pre-processed with tokenizer, stem, stop words.
                Data is vectorized with Tfidf
                Data is clustered by KMeans
                Python has all kinds of magical libraries.
                I am deadly grateful.
Many thanks to https://github.com/brandomr/document_cluster for saving me. 
I read a bunch of research papers but could not find the tools they used to actually play with the data.
So, Brandomr and Python saved me spiritually.
It has been a great time.

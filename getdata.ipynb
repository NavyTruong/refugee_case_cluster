Because she was born in Uzbekistan, she was also singled out for violence and harassment as a scapegoat for the poor living conditions in Tajikistan. Fearing for her life, she fled to Russia and later Kazakhstan, but only met with more harassment and discrimination based on her ethnicity and rejection of the Muslim traditions. In May 2009, she came to the United States and filed her application for asylum. Her case was initially referred by the Asylum Office, but in May 2011, an immigration judge in San Francisco granted her asylum. The judge ruled that she suffered past persecution on account of her religion and nationality. Based on current country conditions in Tajikistan, the judge ruled that the government could not rebut the presumption that she has a well-founed fear in persecution.\n",

      "BIA on February 4, 2008 An IJ had granted asylum to Malian parents who feared that their U.S. citizen daughters would be subjected to FGC. The DHS appealed the decision and the BIA upheld the IJ under Abay v. Ashcroft. The BIA found that the mother's past FGC, in addition to the prevalence of FGC in Mali, and the fact that no laws had been passed to outlaw the practice showed that the parents' fear of their daughters' FGC was well-founded. On October 2, 2007 DHS filed a motion to reconsider based on the recent BIA decisions in Matter of A-K and Matter of A-T-. The Board, however, denied the motion, finding that because the case was in the 6th Circuit, Abay v. Ashcroft applied, and thus its decisions in A-K and A-T- did not fundamentally alter the basis for its decision in the present case.\n",

The gang, La Cuchillada, broke into the family's home and robbed them. The father went to the police and the D.A. to report the crime several times, but nothing was ever done. After gang members found out about the father's attempt to report the robbery, they began to threaten the father with death and the 13 year old daughter with rape. Father and daughter left to the U.S., but mother and two sons stayed behind. Gang members started coming to their house at night, so they moved to another city, but the gang discovered their whereabouts again, so they too fled to the United States. The claim presented was that the father was persecuted by the gang on the basis of his political opinion, which demanded that the government enforce the laws against gang members. In addition, the government of El Salvador was unable and unwilling to control the gang. Clients had been told that the police conspired with the gang by receiving bribes.\n",

Now he would be at risk if returned to Uganda because both sides (LRA and government) would persecute him. The case also raised issues concerning the one-year deadline and whether the persecutor bar applies to child soldiers. The IJ found that exceptional circumstances -of him being an unaccompanied minor and suffering lingering effects of trauma - excused his delay in filing. As for the persecutor bar, the IJ used Supreme Court and Eight Circuit precedent to support his conclusion that the young man was not culpable for acts he opposed but was forced to commit and that mere membership in an organization that engages in persecution does not bar one as a perpetrator. The teenager won asylum before the IJ, who found he had suffered past persecution on account of his Acholi ethnicity and that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his status as a former child soldier.

      "Asylum Officer granted asylum on November 1, 2005. Applicant was from the ethnic minority Pule and from a Muslin background. She was subjected to FGC and feared that her daughters, aged nine and seven, would have to undergo FGC if returned to Guinea. She came to the US on several occasions for treatment of her two sons who have severe health conditions. Her husband left her in 2001, and, in 2004, she asked him for help supporting the children. As a result of her request, the husband had his friends who are in the police force arrest her without charges, and put her in prison. Once in prison, in March or April, 2004, she was placed in the men's holding cell without her blouse for several days. She avoided being abused or raped only by giving all of her food to the men who were in the cell with her. She was finally released after the uncle of a friend of hers pulled strings. Upon release, however, the police told her that she was never to contact or try to contact her husband again. She was informed that if she were ever found to be in violation of this, or even on his street, she would be arrested again. Later that year, she came to the U.S. once again to obtain treatment for her sons. She left her daughters with a friend in Guinea, but her mother took the girls to prepare for FGC. Her friend was able to take the girls back and sent them to the U.S. right away. She applied for asylum and also applied for CAT.\n",

She was subjected to type 4 FGC (genital stretching). This is a ritual in preparation for marriage, as it is thought to increase the husband's sexual pleasure. The elders in her family put a specially made belt on her that pulled on her labia as she walked. The applicant had a daughter born in the US, and therefore a US citizen. She feared that if forced to return to Uganda, her daughter would also be subjected to FGC, and the applicant herself would be forced to undergo the second stage of the pre-marriage ritual, which is to cut the genital area after the elongation is finished. These practices were against the client's Christian beliefs as well.\n",

      "The applicant is a native of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). While she was a student studying at a university in another Arab country on a government scholarship, she was raped by a classmate. He threatened to kill her if she told anyone. As a result, she quit school and moved home. The UAE doctors she saw treated her for health problems she had developed because of the rape, and also informed her that she was pregnant. The doctor advised her to enroll in a U.S. university, given her circumstance of having a child out of wedlock since she was Muslim. She had not told anyone of the rape because of the stigma and shame. Moreover, her brother or father would have killed her to sacrifice the family's honor, without holding the rapist culpable. Since the applicant also had a sister studying at a university in the U.S., she secured a student visa to study abroad in the U.S., staying with her sister. She gave birth to a baby girl while in the U.S. The applicant was able to track down her rapist, who had followed her to the U.S. He was married to a woman unable to have children for at least ten years and allegedly had also raped three other women. He agreed to take financial responsibility of the child only if the applicant gave up all parental rights, or if the applicant agreed to marry him as his second wife. When the applicant refused, he threatened to deny everything. The applicant had no recourse because in her culture, there were no consequences for men who committed rape. In the UAE, having a child out of wedlock was an illegal offense subject to imprisonment. UAE law does not recognize the child. Determined to raise her daughter, the applicant kept the birth a secret from her family in UAE. Her family became suspicious that she may have married a Westerner without permission and managed to terminate her scholarship funds.\n",

      "IJ granted asylum on May 10, 2005. (San Francisco). Applicant was a 25 year old lesbian from Nicaragua. Because of Nicaragua's strong social and religious aversion to homosexuals, the applicant suffered harassment and ostracism by her family and peers. She believed she had no choice but to endure a heterosexual relationship and suppress her feelings toward women. She suffered repeated physical and emotional battering by her common law husband who abused her because of her desire for independence and because he knew she was a lesbian. He would repeatedly beat and rape her, often while taunting her about being a lesbian. At least once she was hospitalized because of the severity of his beatings. He also threatened to kill her on several occasions if she ever left him. She felt that seeking police protection would be futile because her tormentor was a known drug dealer who bragged about his influence and corruption of the police, and also because of the legal, social and religious intolerance of homosexuality and women's rights in Nicaragua.\n",

He began to beat her and tried to rape her. When she resisted, he threw her out of the car and drove away, leaving the applicant naked in the middle of the road. He returned, took her home and then beat and raped her at home. She eventually slipped out of the house and went to her parents’ home where a doctor came and tended to her injuries. Her husband arrived at her parents’ house and took one of their children when she refused to go home with him. He arrived the next day without the child and the applicant called the police, reporting a kidnapping. Domestic violence is not a crime or even worthy of any police attention in Lebanon. When the police arrived and saw that the applicant had been seriously beaten by her husband, they said that domestic violence is a “family matter” and that the couple should go home and “work things out”. In another incident, the applicant’s husband produced a gun and threatened to kill the applicant, and only did not because his father intervened. The applicant’s husband was imprisoned for theft, at which time she decided she wanted a divorce but was dissuaded because both families opposed the divorce and by law, she would have to give up custody of her children. The Catholic Church encouraged her not to get a divorce. After his release, the family moved to the U.S., where the beatings continued. She returned to Lebanon to escape from her husband. Later, after he returned, he was imprisoned for fraud. Upon his release from jail, he began to beat the applicant again and in front of their children.

He demanded his wife and stepdaughters prepare his meals, fetch him a drink, clean his car, remove his shoes and massage his feet, etc. He called his wife and stepdaughters servants and made clear he was the master. He called his wife humiliating names. He taunted his stepdaughters by pulling their hair and ears or hitting them in front of their friends. He threatened to have his undocumented family members deported and falsely accused his wife of domestic violence against him. When he was angry, he would throw shoes, brushes, glasses, and plates at his stepdaughters. He routinely slapped his stepdaughters and daughters. He would pinch them so hard that it would leave bruises on their arms and legs. He would also beat them with the buckle-end of his belt to the point at which his stepdaughter's back was bleeding.

One time, the applicant's husband beat her 20 days after she delivered their first born child, leading to her being hospitalized for a broken nose and bruises and cuts all over her body. After that incident, her husband kicked her out of the house and she was forced to live with her mother for about a year. She eventually returned to her husband's home and later gave birth to her second child. He then began beating her again, nearly every other day for the next few years.

She feared that upon return to Pakistan she would be the victim of an honor killing at the hands of her family or his for having divorced him. She also feared that her family would arrange another forced marriage, and that it would be intentionally abusive in order to \"retrain\" her to be a proper woman.\n",

When she was fifteen years old, the applicantÃ¯Â¿Â½s parents traded her to a neighbor as a wife, in exchange for his assistance in paying off the mortgage on their farm. Her husband routinely raped and beat her, including throwing her against walls and onto the floor and striking her in the face, sending her to the hospital. G went to the police two times for protection, but was told they could do nothing because the problem was personal. Once, when she left her husband, he filed papers to gain custody of their child. G met with an official at the district attorney's office and mentioned the violence and her fear that the child would be abused, but the official said that her husband would be the better provider because of his job. G then tried to kill herself. At age twenty, after her husband tried to kill her with a machete, she again ran away with her two children, including her newborn, and lived in a shed in the marketplace. After a few days, her parents and husband tracked her down, and her mother held her down while her husband beat her with a stick. He took their children, whom she has not seen since. G fled to an aunt's house, and left the country a few weeks later.\n",

She was beaten throughout her childhood by her mother with wooden or wire hangers on her hips and legs, or with open hands for cutting her hair short and refusing to conform to traditional styles of dress for girls, which went against Islamic laws. Her father put a knife to her throat when she was nine for choosing male playmates and playing boys games. The applicant had feelings for other girls from a young age, first kissing another girl when she was eight years old. She realized she was a lesbian when she was twenty-one years old. She was forced to have relationships in secret for fear of the religious police, Mutawwa'in, who uphold the laws of Shari'a in Saudi Arabia. Lesbianism is punishable by death. She fears being punished or killed if the truth is found out about her sexual preference. Her parents have attempted to force her to marry on several occasions, but she has vehemently refused. She has suffered due to her liberal view of Islam, enduring beatings, and being locked in an unlit room when she refused to pray at prescribed times. She has attempted suicide more than once and experienced deep depressions due to the pressures of living in a repressive and religiously conservative Arab country and family.\n",

      "When the applicant was twelve, her father raped her at least three times. When she told her mother about the incident, her mother accused her of lying and told her not to go to the police. She then went to a local priest, and he told her to forgive her father. Two years later, she ran away to Guatemala City. At the age of seventeen, the applicant was married. After a few years, her husband began seeing another woman and severely beating the applicant on a daily basis and raping her. Twice, while she was pregnant, he beat her so badly that she had miscarriages, and he often threatened to kill her. In 1993, the applicant filed for divorce and fled to the United States. After about four years, her ex-husband came to her home in Arkansas and moved in with her. Because she wouldn’t share a bed with him, he began beating her again. She called the police and her husband was arrested, and she believes he was deported. The applicant does not want to return to Guatemala because of the awful memories of what her father did to her, and because she is afraid her ex-husband will kill her. She knows that in Guatemala he could do this and not face repercussions.\n",

      "If returned to Jordan, F.O. faces death at the hands of the male members of her family because of her alleged sexual transgressions (\"honor killing\"). The term \"honor killing\" refers to the practice in Jordan and other Middle Eastern and South Asian countries in which male members of the family are duty-bound to kill a female family member who they think has brought dishonor and shame to their family. In 1991, F.O. and her now-husband, H. secretly started spending time together. They had premarital sex and H. proposed marriage. However, F.O.?s father forbade the marriage because H. is Palestinian and had a low paying job. Fearing that she would be killed if her family found out she had lost her virginity, F.O. decided to flee Jordan with H. and to get married abroad. The airport police told F.O.?s father that she left the country. Her father has ordered the male members to kill her on sight. F.O. has learned through letters from her sister, spanning over five years, that her father is enraged and has said that the shame she has brought on the family can only be removed by \"blood\". He has made her brothers swear to kill her at any place and time they find her, and he has also demanded that all her male relatives- including uncles and cousins- kill her if they ever come in contact with her. In the most recent letter, F.O. learned that her father said that he cannot rest in peace even if he dies, and if he dies before he can kill her, he will only rest in peace if her male relatives carry out the killings.\n",

She was not allowed out of the house because he said it was dangerous, and he would come visit her periodically.

      "The applicant is a citizen of Mexico, as is her 19 yr old daughter, a derivative applicant. The applicant's husband began to abuse her soon after their marriage. He psychologically abused her by attempting to control everything she did, changing the locks on the house, controlling all the money, and eventually not bringing food home. The physical abuse consisted of beating, slapping, kicking, choking, pulling her hair, and throwing her down the stairs, among other acts. He also committed extensive and extremely brutal sexual violence against her. When the applicant protested the abuse, he told her that as his wife she was his bought property, just as he made his children, and so could do with them whatever he wanted. As their daughters became older, his abuse of them became more sexual in nature. Of their four daughters, one was abused the most because she would stand up for the applicant when the applicant was being abused. Eventually the applicant began to defy her husband and challenge his authority, although this inevitably intensified the abuse. At one point, the family moved to the U.S., and her husband's behavior improved markedly, a change the applicant attributed to a stronger system of law in the U.S., and the fact that the applicant's brothers lived nearby. When a brother arrived at the house, the husband's aggressive behavior would stop. The applicant appealed to the police for protection many times, sometimes calling them, sometimes going to the police station. The police never gave her any real help, telling her that she had to obey him because he was her husband. The police also told her they couldn't do anything if she didn't have permanent marks. Several times they sent her husband a notice to appear to discuss the abuse, but they took no action when he ignored these requests. The applicant also made several unsuccessful attempts to get help from government agencies in obtaining a divorce. The applicant's husband had connections with the Judicial Police, who are very powerful and have many contacts within the government After the applicant's attempts to get a divorce, her husband used his Judicial Police contacts to implement his threats to have her stalked and killed.

      "Ms. K- is from the capital city of Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). She is 50 years old and has been in INS detention since March of 1998. She married her husband, an officer in former President Mobutu's military, in 1974, at the age of 25. They have four children together, the youngest of which is eight years old. Throughout their marriage, Ms. K's husband exerted complete control over her and, in 1988, forced Ms. K to quit her job as a bank secretary. In 1991, her husband ordered her to have an abortion six months into her pregnancy and was only able to avoid having to comply because the doctor said it would threaten her life to abort at that point in the pregnancy. In 1995, Ms. K's husband shot a colleague but, through his connections to then ruler Mobutu's family, he was able to escape prosecution. After this incident her husband became emboldened in his abuse against Ms. K. He began physically abusing her on a regular basis. He would kick her and beat her, often in front of their children. Ms. K's husband repeatedly raped her, inflicting her with infections and sexually transmitted diseases. He frequently threatened to kill her with his gun. During one particularly violent incident, Ms. K's husband knocked out her tooth, dislocated her jaw, and punched her in the eye so hard that she required stitches. At her asylum hearing, she testified she had undergone surgery on her left eye and due to the physical abuse by her husband had problems with her nose, neck, head, spinal column, hip, and foot. Finally in 1998 her husband beat, punched, and kicked her so badly she lost consciousness. Ms. K- knew it was futile to go to the police for help not only because of her husband's connections to Mobutu's family, but also because, as she testified at her hearing: \"women are nothing\" in the Congo. Under Congolese law a married woman is considered legally incompetent. A woman cannot obtain a divorce without her husband's consent. A married woman cannot obtain a job, open a bank account, or rent an apartment withouther husband's written permission. According to the U.S. State Department's Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC) - Formerly Zaire: Profile of Asylum Claims & Country Conditions (March 1998), as quoted by the Immigration Judge: \"Domestic violence, including rape and beatings, is widespread but rarely reported. The problem is handled within the extended family and only in the most extreme instances is the matter brought to the police. There are no provisions under the law for spousal battery. There are no crisis centers or hotlines. The problem of violence against women is largely ignored by the general population and the media.\" After the beating in January of 1998, Ms. K- went into hiding and then fled to the United States in search of a safe haven from her husband.\n",

While FGC may be practiced in her tribe, the Itsekiri, it is not promoted and she did not have to submit to this procedure. However, FGC is widely practiced in her husband's tribe, the Urhobo; his mother and sisters have all undergone FGC. Her husband's family was against their marriage because she had not undergone FGC and was considered impure. Their beliefs regarding this matter are so strong that they demanded that she undergo this procedure when she was pregnant, despite the potential danger to her and the unborn child. Her husband shielded her from his family's harassment. But he died in their sixth year of marriage. Children are deemed to belong to the husband's tribe, and his has threatened to take her children away from her and perform FGC on her daughter. The husband's family practices animism. Within their belief system, it is assumed that when a husband passes away at a young age his widow is responsible for his death. Although her husband's family was aware of his medical problems, they blamed his early death on her, calling her a witch. The widow can be cleared of her guilt through a series of widow rituals which include being locked in the same room with the husband's corpse at night, head-shaving, and drinking the water used to bathe the husband's corpse. The husband's family ordered her to undergo the widow rituals, even though she is a Christian and the rituals are against her beliefs. Although the rituals are meant to determine whether the assumed guilt can be lifted, the interpretation of the widow's response to the rituals is arbitrary and his family could decide that she is guilty regardless of what happens. Further, they could take her children from her or kill her if they confirmed her guilt. She states that the Nigerian government will not interfere with what they consider to be domestic disputes over widow rituals, FGC and family violence. She fled to the United States for her own and her children's safety.\n",

Because her husband's relatives carry a lot of weight in Jordan, no one would be willing to protect her in that community. Further, the police will not intervene since they perceive domestic disputes as part of the husband's authority. Her husband has already returned to Jordan, and the applicant fears that if she's forced to join him, his wrath would be so severe that he would kill her, or possibly hire an assassin to kill her. The applicant's two children are now in their teens. Her daughters will be subjected to honor killings if they return to Jordan because they have been sexually active before marriage, as is customary in the United States. A male relative would thus want to cleanse the family honor by killing them.\n",

      "The applicant grew up in a poor family and worked as a hotel maid. The hotel manager would ask her out and made passes at her, something which she found disturbing since she believed that a relationship between an employer and an employee should be respectful and distant. One night the manager assaulted and tried to rape the applicant and in self-defense she stabbed him in the leg with a pair of scissors. She was arrested. When the applicant reported the attempted rape the police told her she should be glad to have the attention of a man with wealth and status. The police never investigated her accusation. The applicant was held in detention for thirty days; she never had a trial but was told that she would receive a three-year sentence for stabbing the hotel manager. When the applicant's parents begged the manager to drop the charge, he demanded that they pay for his medical expenses that had allegedly resulted from the stabbing. The parents could not pay the whole sum and the manager then offered to let the applicant pay off the rest by working at a hair salon that he managed. The salon was really a brothel that he ran together with the local police. The applicant was brought to the brothel and was expected to lead the life of a prostitute. The applicant objected to being a prostitute and wanted to preserve her virginity. She was able to escape after three days and the police have since put out a warrant for her arrest.\n",

Since she fled, state security officials have come to her home looking for her. She cannot contact her husband or their children because it would put them in danger. The applicant fears that she will be arrested and either tortured or killed if she returns. Further, the applicant was forced to undergo FGM when she was six years old, although both her parents oppose the practice. She was home alone with her grandmother when two women came to the house and performed FGM on her. Her grandmother was powerless to stop them.

In Guinea, arranged and forced marriages are common and the government does not intervene. She refused this marriage, and was beaten by her father for her disobedience. Her refusal and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father and other relatives continued for two years. In 1999 her family and the family of her husband-to-be held a religious wedding ceremony in which the couple was not involved. That night, the applicant?s new husband raped her. Over the course of the following few months he repeatedly raped and beat her for her unwillingness to be married to him. After six months, the applicant escaped to Canada. Her husband tracked her down there and called her, threatening to have her taken back to Guinea. She fled Canada for the United States. The applicant fears that if she returns to Guinea she will continue to suffer severe abuse and possibly death at the hand of her family and husband for disobeying them.

Immediately after their marriage, her husband began to abuse her verbally and physically. He would accuse her of flirting with other men and of having affairs, shouting at her, calling her vulgar and cruel names, and hitting her. When she became pregnant with their son, her husband continued to abuse her physically and verbally. He also threatened to hurt her family. After the birth of her son by caesarian-section, her doctor told her to abstain from sex. Her husband forced her to have sex anyway, shouting and cursing at her when she resisted, and sexually humiliating her. Her doctor told her that her blood pressure was dangerously high. When she became pregnant again, her doctor told her to be careful because of the complications during her previous pregnancy. Her husband ignored these instructions and ordered her to perform rigorous work. When she would object, he would punch her. One day he became enraged and kicked her in her abdomen. He left her on the floor bleeding. She miscarried the baby. While recovering from her miscarriage, her husband continued to rape her. When she became pregnant again, his abusive behavior resulted in an emergency C-section. She nearly died from the complications. While she was recovering he continued his pattern of daily physical, sexual, and verbal abuse. At one point, in desperation, she attempted to commit suicide. Her husband became a powerful government official with ties to organized crime. He used his position to threaten and harass her family. Eventually, he threw her out of the house for having gone to the doctor without his permission. When he ordered her to come home she refused. He told her parents that if they ever tried to contact her two sons that he would kill them and that he would never give them up. He threatened to kill her, her brother, and her parents. He also threatened to have her gang raped by thugs. Eventually, fearful that her refusal to go back to her husband would endanger her family, she returned to her husband. His abuses continued. At one point he threatened to pour sulfuric acid on her face so that she could not go out in public. He also abused their two sons, physically and verbally. The applicant’s husband’s work brought the applicant, her husband, and their two sons to the United States. He continued his pattern of extreme abuse.

Although forced marriages are against the law in China, the practice remains common, especially in rural areas where such feudal family traditions remain. Girls between the ages of 16 and 20 are married to men of their parents' choosing in exchange for money. While boys have the ability to chose their partners, girls do not. Once married, girls become the \"property\" of the husbands' family and are often completely cut off from their families and communities.

The man roughly passed her around from person to person saying, ï¿½Isnï¿½t she pretty?ï¿½ This is considered a derogatory remark in India. The Hindu government encourages religious intolerance of Christians. The applicantï¿½s name is identifiably tribal Christian. When she was taking her high school graduation exam she was forced to omit her name from the exam. As a result, her graduation certificate, an important legal identification document in India, does not contain her name. While in a government medical school, the applicant was stigmatized and harassed for being a tribal Christian by teachers and students. She was shunned from group projects. She did not attend school for one year because of fear of humiliation. On one occasion, the applicant was riding a bus when about six Hindu men approached her. The men harassed her with vulgar comments. She believes that the men harassed her because she was Christian. After about thirty minutes of this treatment, she was able to get off of the bus and away from the men. A few years later, the applicant and her mother purchased an apartment in Dehli.

Her family continued to treat her as a boy throughout her teenage years. Generally, this resulted in preferential treatment at home. In school, the applicant experienced numerous instances of physical and verbal abuse when her sexual orientation was discovered. The school directors slapped her and made her sign some sort of document. Her religion teacher told her that she was cursed and that she would have killed her if she were her daughter.

The applicant did not want to defy her father because she was afraid he would hurt her and because she was afraid that he would not permit her to travel to the U.S. again. The applicant is afraid of returning to Morocco because she fears that her father will kill her if she shames the family by refusing to get married. At the very least he will take away her passport, making it impossible to leave the country. The police will not help her if they discover that the reason she does not want to get married is because she is a lesbian. She also will not be able to hide out because it is nearly impossible to get a job without revealing your family background to your employer.

The applicant's husband beat, raped and threatened her life. He broke the applicant's arm on two separate occasions. He raped her throughout their marriage. Once the applicant's husband threatened to rape her less than a month after her hysterectomy, ignoring the doctor's order that she had to abstain from sex for at least three months, and was only stopped by the presence of her family members. He bragged to the applicant about his infidelities. Since 1986, the applicant has repeatedly but unsuccessfully sought to divorce her husband. The first time she tried, her husband's brother in law, the clerk of the court, asserted that there was no record of the divorce petition having been filed. Three years later, when she filed again, the judge spoke only to her and \"strongly recommended\" that she reconcile with her husband, and she submitted. Five years later she filed again. However, the judge is her husband's friend and has not signed the divorce decree. The applicant's husband threatened to harm the applicant's attorney and her family, thus the attorney withdrew from the case. A month after she filed for the third time, four armed police officers came to the applicant's home and told her that they were under orders \"from above\" to kill her if she did not withdraw the divorce petition. A few months later, her husband drove her to meet a man who he said was going to kill her if she did not withdraw her petition. The man wore dark sunglasses and carried a gun.

Finally, at a family party, the applicant's husband threatened to kill her in five months, when her divorce petition was supposed to become final. At that point, the applicant left her children in the care of her mother and fled Guatemala.\n",

      "The applicant is a human rights worker who has been actively involved in women’s rights work with an organization based in Pakistan. She has also participated in other organizing activities in Afghanistan and Pakistan that help women live under the Taliban and educate others on the lack of women’s rights under the Taliban. Her husband was also openly active in the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan, and the family moved many times to elude imminent danger in Pakistan. In the mid-1990s, the applicant accompanied a group of journalists documenting the conditions for women under Taliban rule. Radio reports described her and the group of journalists, announcing that anyone seeing them should report them to the police. The Taliban constantly questioned her relatives about her by name, demanding to know her whereabouts and recent activities. In 1997, the applicant was conversing with another woman on the street when a Taliban agent ordered her to stop, telling her that it was illegal for her to be on the street unaccompanied by a man. When she told him that she was only trying to give the other woman helpful information, the agent whipped her with a rubber strap for talking back to him and left her lying in the street. A Taliban agent also came to the applicant’s office, accusing her of trying to convert Muslims to Christianity and warned that she would be killed if she continued her work. She received death threats every two to three weeks. In 1998, a Taliban agent stopped her in the street. He told her that the Taliban knew all about her, described her activities, listed her entire family by name, and told her she would be arrested and killed if she continued her work. Despite the threats to her life, the applicant felt compelled to continue her activism for women’s rights. In 1999, the applicant’s husband was arrested, detained, and tortured for two months. The Taliban beat him with steel rods, electrocuted him, and whipped him with rubber straps, demanding to know about his wife’s activities and whereabouts. Over the next year, the threats against the applicant escalated to “official” Taliban pronouncements, naming her in public announcements and sending her notices. If the applicant is forced to return to Pakistan or Afghanistan, her torture and death is highly likely.\n",

      "The applicant's father allowed her to attend the University as long as she majored in Islamic Religion. When a male student colleague telephone her at home, her father threatened him and beat her, stating that by talking to a man, she had brought shame to the family. Her stepbrother then beat her so badly that she was taken to the hospital. The police were notified but she did not answer their questions because her father said that he would kill her if she reported the abuse to the police. The police requested that her father go to the police station, but when he did not comply, there were no repercussions -- the applicant believes this is because he was friends with the police officers. When she returned home from the hospital, her stepbrother beat her again and this time she tried to kill herself. She was taken to the hospital again and her father was issued an order to appear in court. She and her father appeared before a judge, who told her that she should not talk to men and that her father and brother mean well. When the applicant told her father that she wanted to pursue a Master's Degree, he beat her badly; she again tried to commit suicide. She was hospitalized and the police were again summoned.

He began abusing her early in their relationship, but she could not return to her parents because they had disapproved of the relationship. The boyfriend was a police officer, and therefore the applicant felt she could not report the abuse to the local police, who were friends with her boyfriend. Less than a year after she moved in, two intruders broke into the house and raped the applicant. After this incident, her boyfriend became even more abusive, locking her in the house, sodomizing her, and once even breaking her nose.

A year after that, he returned again and convinced her to get back together with him. The abuse began again, and the applicant was too afraid of her boyfriend?s power and status as an ex-policeman to go to the authorities.\n",

      "The applicant is a Tamil Christian woman who married a Sinhalese Buddhist man. Her mother was Sinhala; her father Tamil. Her husband has connections with the police in Colombo, including family and friends. The couple lived in her mother's home; they had two female children. In 1983, riots broke out between Tamils and Singhalese in Colombo; many Tamils were killed, including by the police and the army. A group came to their home, but her husband persuaded them to leave. Her husband was disappointed that she gave birth to first one, then another daughter; he wanted a son. He was bitter, and told her that a Tamil womb cannot give birth to a high-class Sinhala son. After the second daughter's birth, he did not come to see her for four days. Once, he shaved both girls' heads, so that they looked like boys. Her husband insisted that they sell her parent's home and move, against her will. One day in 1984, a male friend of her husband's came to see her where she worked. He told her that her husband was seriously ill and that he wanted to take her to see him. He drove her outside the city, took her to a small house, and raped her. He took her back to work. She later learned that her husband owed this man money, and she suspects that the rape was an act of revenge. She suspects that her husband knew of the rape. He first became physically abusive at their daughter's baptism; his family had refused to participate in the Christian ritual. The abuse continued and worsened after the birth of their second child. He would become enraged at small things and beat her with his hands. He would slap her face and pull her by the hair; he once threw hot tea in her face. He beat and raped her often. Once she was beaten so badly that she went to the hospital. Her husband insisted on having sexual relations every day. She could not enjoy sex after being mistreated and abused. During her period, he forced her to have anal intercourse, which she found painful and humiliating. Once he made her spend the night at the home of a policeman friend, who attempted to force himself on her. Although she had a steady job and provided much of the family's income, she had to give her money to her husband. He called her a \"Tamil prostitute\" and her mother a \"Sinhala disgrace\" for marrying a Tamil man, her father, and said that Christians were \"cheaters.\" After one beating, when her mother treated her wounds with \"holy oil\" from church, he described it as urine and threw it out the window. She was afraid to dress or live like a traditional Tamil woman. When once she sought help from her husband's mother, the woman slapped her face and said that her son would have a son by now if he had married a Sinhala woman. Desperate to escape, she twice attempted suicide. When she went to the police, her husband followed her and told them to dismiss her complaint. That same day, his family threatened her never again to go to the police. Although she again sought protection from the police, there was no response. In 1990, she filed for divorce, although she had trouble finding a lawyer who would represent a Tamil Christian woman against a Sinhalese Buddhist. She gained custody of the children, in whom her husband had no interest. However, her ex-husband continued to harass her. While the divorce was pending, he forced his way into the house and beat her very badly; when she went to the police the officer asked her to go to the hospital. He would follow her from work or find her at her bus stop. Still the police refused to act on her complaints. In 1995, her home was ransacked on three occasions by the police. The officers explained that there was a complaint that she had been sheltering Tamils; she suspects that her ex-husband is behind the raids. In 1996, her home was surrounded and searched by soldiers or police on several occasions. Afraid of the raids, she decided to marry again; her ex-husband also remarried and is father to another girl. Both she and her husband continue to be threatened by her ex-husband. He contacted her at work and at home. She became pregnant in 1997, and learned that it was to be a boy. Her ex- husband called her at home and specifically threatened her unborn child. Afraid of her ex- husband, the police and the military, she decided to leave Sri Lanka.\n",

      "The applicant entered the United States in 1994 as the non-immigrant fiance of a United States citizen. On arrival to the United States she learned her fiance no longer wanted to marry her. She thereafter married a Ukrainian national who was a lawful permanent resident who applied for an immigrant visa for her. After she learnt that her fiance was no longer willing to marry her she subsequently applied for asylum and withholding of deportation on the grounds that, while living in Russia, she had been repeatedly abducted and raped, for over two and a half years, by members of the Chechen mafia, a quasi-governmental entity. As a result of the rapes, the applicant became pregnant and had an abortion. She was threatened and told not to disclose the rape and abduction when she was allowed to go home. The local authorities declined to assist her parents and after leaving Russia, the Chechen mafia burnt her parents' dacha. The Chechen mafia have continually threatened the applicant's parents with death should the applicant return to Russia.\n",

      "The applicant believes members of the Chechen mafia kidnapped her. She was drugged and awoke naked in a bed in an apartment. Two men handcuffed her to the bed and over the next seven days she was beaten and gang-raped, as well as verbally abused. After she was released, the applicant learned that her parents had repeatedly gone to the police. Her parents had told the police that they suspected the Chechen mafia had kidnapped their daughter, but the police refused investigate her disappearance, stating that they did not need any extra problems. The police are known take money from the mafia in exchange for impunity for their crimes. A few days after her release, the men who had kidnapped her contacted her by phone and told her that she or her parents should not go to the police. She was told not to leave the city and warned that she would be found if she left. Two weeks later, she was again kidnapped and raped by the same men. After this incident, these men took her from her home on a weekly basis to be beaten and raped. She was taken over a hundred times over a two and half year period. She became pregnant from the rapes, and had an abortion. The applicant sought repeated medical help for injuries. She was suicidal. Since her departure from Russia, she has learned from her parents that these men continue to search for her and have threatened to kill her if she returns.\n",

      "The applicant lived with her boyfriend for 3 years. Throughout their relationship, the applicant's boyfriend beat her several times a week. In 1995 the applicant was pregnant and her boyfriend beat her so badly that she believes her baby was born dead as a result. Soon after she lost that child, her boyfriend raped her and she became pregnant again. She gave birth to a daughter in 1996 and then her boyfriend started hitting their daughter when she was only five months old. The applicant's mother encouraged her to leave when she found out about the beatings. The applicant could not escape to any other family members' homes because they all live in the same village as her boyfriend's family. When the applicant left her boyfriend, he warned her he would make her pay for leaving.\n",

In 1989, she participated in an anti-government demonstration, at which she was attacked and knocked unconscious by government security forces. She was subsequently detained and tortured, verbally abused, and threatened. The applicant attended a university in Sudan where she was active in a women?s rights group. In the 1990s, she was lashed as punishment for refusing to comply with the Islamic dress code. Also, throughout the time that the NIF regime has been in power, the applicant has routinely been followed, stopped in the streets, harassed, and government forces have pointed a gun at her on a few occasions.

      "The applicant is from the Ibo tribe in Nigeria. As an infant, she underwent FGM because it was expected for every female in the tribe. The applicant was very young when she underwent FGM and does not remember the procedure. Typically, elderly women performed the surgery using non-sterile razor blades, administering no painkillers. She still suffers physically and psychologically from the FGM. The applicant had a very painful and dangerous childbirth. Sexual intercourse is also very painful for the applicant. She and her husband have considered separating because of problems due to FGM. The psychological effects from the FGM are extensive for the applicant; she feels a loss of self-esteem, mental trauma and pain. Both as a Christian and because of her own painful experiences, the applicant is opposed to having her United States-born daughters undergo FGM. If returned to Nigeria, the tribal elders would force the circumcision on her daughters. If she resisted, she and her family would be ostracized. Her daughters would never be able to marry in Nigeria because they be would considered “immoral” if they were not circumcised. They cannot move to Christian parts of Nigeria because of the violence against Christians by the Islamic government. Nevertheless, the tribal customs are followed, specifically FGM, even among Christians in Nigeria.\n",

      "There are many restrictions placed on women in Saudi Arabia. The religious police, the Mutawan, enforce the strict segregation of the sexes. They arrest people for violating any of the social rules of male and female conduct. The applicant is from a middle class family. She was allowed to go to school, but her schools, even college, were segregated and unequal to those of men. The employment market is also segregated; only education, medicine and government work are open to women. The applicant obtained a degree in a \"non-traditional\" field, and was not allowed to work. She has many other interests and talents, but was prevented from pursuing them because of the restrictions placed on women. In Saudi society, females are not allowed to leave their home without a male escort. The applicant was left stranded at school many times because her male companion did not come to pick her up. She attended a protest where women were driving cars in defiance of the social ban against women driving. The applicant believes the most unbearable Saudi custom was having to wear a veil. Members of the Mutawan have confronted the applicant on numerous occasions, ordering her to cover her face. The applicant’s father was not very strict about the applicant adhering to the official codes of moral conduct. He gave his permission and arranged for her to study in the United States without a male companion. However, her father cannot control the Mutawan from reprimanding her if they allege she is behaving \"improperly\". Furthermore, her father will eventually arrange her marriage, but the applicant adamantly opposes the idea of a traditional marriage because she believes her rights will be even further restricted. The applicant is vocal about her dislike of the situation of Saudi women. She believes that women and men should have equal rights, but when she expresses this belief, even to her family members, she is looked upon as crazy. Saudi officials know that she is in the U.S. without a male escort. Moreover, the applicant believes that the government is aware of her strongly held beliefs on women’s rights and that she will be harmed if returned to Saudi Arabia.\n",

      "The applicant is from a poor rural town. She got married when she was 18 years old, and her husband began physically, emotionally, sexually and verbally abusing her soon thereafter. He would come home and beat her two or three times a week with whatever objects he could find. He would beat her to \"teach her to be a better wife,\"to \"mind her own business,\" or to \"show her who was in control.\" He would also beat her to punish her for not having his dinner ready or for not keeping their children quiet. Her husband forbade her from visiting family and friends. Over the course of nearly two decades, she had seven children. As soon as the children came into their lives, they too became the targets of her husband's abuse. He beat the children if they interfered with his assaults against the applicant, or to just punish them. Her husband once held a gun to her with her infant child in her arms. The applicant did not go to the police because they lived in a rural town and had no telephone; the closest police station is a day away by horse. Neighbors did not intervene during the assaults. Ten years into her marriage, the applicant's husband began working periodically in the U.S. He would send money to her with instructions to save every penny of it, leaving no money for the applicant or her children to survive on. The applicant and her children eventually came to the U.S., partly because she knew her husband did not have the right to abuse her in the U.S. Her husband only hit her once in the U.S., but he threatened to beat her if they were ever to return to Mexico. However, her husband beat her daughter once and when the police became involved, three of the children were placed in foster care.\n",

      "The applicant was born in Pakistan to a Muslim family. She married a man of the Bahai faith who was born in Pakistan of Iranian citizenship. Her parents were against the marriage because he was of a different faith. Since they married outside of their faith, the applicant and her husband had to flee from Pakistan to avoid persecution by Muslims in Pakistan. They moved to Africa and lived in Tanzania and Botswana. In the past few years, the applicant's husband has become physically abusive. Neither of the countries they have lived in provide adequate resources to protect her from her husband. The authorities in Botswana refused to intervene and told the applicant that she should be a better wife if she wants to be safe. She has no where to go in Botswana that she would be safe from her husband. There are no services for battered women in Botswana. The applicant cannot permanently return to Pakistan because of the \"crime\" she committed by marrying outside of her faith. Furthermore, she has no male relatives in Pakistan who would protect her. Without protection, the applicant would face the severe discrimination, even rape or murder, that is meted out on women who live with no male head of household. She cannot return to Iran because she is not an Iranian resident\n",

      "As customary in Indian culture, the applicant's family arranged her marriage. After their engagement, his family started asking her family for money and demanded expensive wedding arrangements. She found letters from his parents stating that she was not good enough for him, implying that she did not bring his family enough dowry. Her husband became verbally abusive, echoing the same sentiments, and later became sexually and physically abusive. When she became pregnant, the abuse escalated. He kicked her in the stomach, threw tea and coffee in her face, hit her with his hands, shoved her and pulled her hair. He and his family continued to demand money from her family. The applicant suffered a miscarriage due to her husband’s abuse. The couple came to the United States for work, but she returned to India for the birth of her second child. He eventually threatened to take the children away from her if she did not immediately join him in the U.S. In the U.S., he did not allow her to call or write her parents, except to ask for money. He continued to beat and whip her. When his parents came to the U.S. to visit, all three of them emotionally and physically abused the applicant. She was unable to seek medical care for her many injuries because he would not let her out of the house. One time, he dragged her out of the house, forcing her to leave the children home alone. The police were notified and she and her husband were charged with child neglect. The applicant eventually felt she could no longer take the abuse, so she fled her home, went to the police and secured a restraining order. His parents soon left for India and he followed. In India his family is threatening her parents with bodily harm, spreading rumors about her and vowing to avenge the \"dishonor\" she has brought on them. Her divorce is now final.\n",

      "The applicant is of the Fullah ethnic group in Sierra Leone. The lighter-skinned Fullah peoples are considered to be of the wealthier business class, and are targets of harassment as a result. Members of the Fullah ethnic group are sometimes not considered to be from Sierra Leone; her mother was once deported to Guinea, which country returned her as she was not from Guinea. They are also considered to be opponents of both the government and the rebels. Fullah members' property is often seized or attacked; her father's cousin was murdered, her mother's store ransacked, and she was called a prostitute by other children in school. She was subjected to FGM when she was 9 years old. Her mother was opposed to the ritual, but her father was dead and his brother insisted upon it. She ran away to a relative's house but her uncle found her and brought her back. She still suffers from the effects of the procedure. In April 1995, rebel soldiers raided her village. The soldiers found a group of women who were hiding, including her and her mother. The older women were taken away; she has not seen her mother since. Along with 5-6 other young women she was taken together with a few young men back to the rebel camp. The girls were beaten and raped. The young men tried to intervene and were killed. The girls were forced to cook and to gather food in the fields; while in the fields, she escaped. She fled to a refugee camp in Guinea and made her way to her cousin's in the U.S. But her cousin raped her and threatened to turn her over to the INS.\n",

      "The applicant's home town saw constant fighting between the area’s heavy guerrilla population and the military. In the late 1980’s, she moved away to attend a private nursing school and a public university. The public university had a very active FMLN organization. The applicant sympathized with FLMN’s ideas, attended meetings and helped in small ways, but she never became highly involved because she feared the repercussions. A few years later, she was assigned to a military hospital for her practical training. Her friends at the public university did not like that she was working for the military and accused her of being a spy, so she stopped attending the FMLN meetings. Then the military supervisor at the hospital interrogated her, inferring that the applicant was a spy for the FLMN. Soon after, her mother told the applicant that two men had come by inquiring about her whereabouts. The applicant was visiting her parents when a group of armed men wearing military boots invaded their home, saying that they were looking for “that subversive, your daughter.” The men said they were going kill the applicant for being a traitor. The men beat her mother and then her father. They then gang-raped her 14-year-old sister. They eventually found the applicant, and beat and raped her. Apparently they did not know she was the one they were looking for. After this incident, the applicant and her siblings went to live with their grandmother in another town. However, a few months later her younger brother disappeared and has never been seen again. The army captured her other brother and he was beaten, tortured with electric shocks and kept in prison for a month.\n",

      "The applicant was born after her mother had an affair with her father, who was already married and had several grown children. Her mother died when she was a child, and she was raised by her \"aunt\", whom she later learned was her half-sister (her father's legitimate daughter). Her aunt's family is wealthy and powerful with many political and business ties. Her aunt's husband was an officer in the Salvadoran Army and her son was a pilot in the Salvadoran Air Force. Her aunt's family actively supported ARENA, the political party that represented the wealthy and elite, and her aunt held positions in the party. The applicant's aunt and family never treated the applicant like a family member; she had to do all the cooking, cleaning and was beaten almost every day by her aunt. Her aunt would whip her, pull her hair, throw her against the wall and verbally abuse her, calling her names like \"imbecile\", \"idiot\" and a \"prostitute like [her] mother\". Her aunt's husband, an officer, and her son both physically and sexually abused the applicant. When she was 10 years old, her aunt's son handcuffed the applicant, put a pillow over her face and raped her. After this incident, the aunt's husband started raping her also and terrorizing her with his gun and making death threats. He would show names of his military connections to prove his powers. He continued to sexually abuse the applicant even when she moved out of his home. The applicant was so miserable that she tried to commit suicide twice. The applicant's aunt forced the applicant, but not any of her own children, to participate in the youth group of ARENA. The applicant did not believe in ARENA's platform and instead identified with the opposition, since she believed they represented poor and oppressed people like her. When the applicant voiced her opinion to her family, she was beaten, punished or verbally abused. The family's involvement in ARENA resulted in an assassination attempt, after which they fled to the U.S., but refused to take the applicant. At college, the applicant continued her participation in ARENA at the demand of another aunt, but continued to receive death threats from the opposition and no help from her family. The applicant fears that her well-connected family would find her if she went back to El Salvador and they would subject her again to the abuse and humiliation she suffered from in the past.\n",

      "The applicant grew up as one of 14 siblings whose father, a farmer, believed in educating even his female children. She studied through 10th grade. At age 15, however, her family married her off and she went to live with her husband's family. Her husband came from a wealthy and powerful family; he worked for the government. She was unhappy living with his family, while her husband lived in the capital. The rules also required her to eat after men, walk behind men, cover her face and never speak with a man outside of the family. She had to follow the family's strict Hindu rules, including forced fasting, and was beaten by her mother-in-law for violations of the rules. She moved to Kathmandu with her husband, but he beat her and treated her like a servant. She met some foreigners who introduced her to Christianity, which she began to follow. While it is legal to change religions in Nepal, it is illegal to attempt to convert someone. Christians are seen as unclean in this primarily Hindu society, as they eat beef. She pursued her interest in Christianity in secret. When her husband discovered Christian literature, he forced her to do \"gaudan,\" a Hindu cleansing ritual. He sent her back to his parents home, where she was mocked and mistreated for her beliefs. Later, she was taunted for her religious beliefs at work. She gave birth to a son at her in-laws, but was fed and treated poorly and became ill until her father came and brought her to his home. But as a married women, she could not remain with her parents without damaging her younger sisters' chances for marriage. She left her children with her parents for their own protection. Her husband consistently attempted to thwart her efforts to continue her education. She attempted suicide. She gave birth to a stillborn, then a daughter. While living with her parents, she continued her college education, but her husband objected. After she turned to a friend for help killing herself, her husband relented. She obtained a college degree in Kathmandu. Her husband then objected to her wish to work outside the home. He called the police and showed them her Christian books. They arrested her due to her husband's position in government, but released her. She worked for an airline, and was subject to abuse from her husband for this activity. He succeeded in forcing her to quit one job. She also continued her studies, obtaining a masters degree. For a number of years she lived with just her daughter, working in another town. Members of her husband's family would visit to spy on her, as it was assumed that she was doing something wrong by living separate from her husband. The money she earned was not her own; instead, her husband treated it like his own property. When her husband learned that she was attending Christian meetings, he beat her and called the police. She was arrested and beaten. She contacted a women's protective center, which gave her some hope until they refused to help her when they learned of her religious beliefs from her husband. Later, another women's group told her to get a divorce, but she would rather be dead than divorced in Nepal, where divorced women are ostracized, treated as prostitutes, and exploited by men. She was blamed when her daughter entered a \"love-marriage\" with a person from another caste, which is considered shameful. She was forbidden to meet her daughter, and after she did so, she was severely beaten and could not go to work for a week. She took advantage of an opportunity to come to the United States in 1991, but did not know how to get permission to remain, and she mistakenly returned to Nepal when her husband promised never to hurt her again. He soon again had her arrested for her religious practices, and she was kept overnight in a cell. Her husband often threatened to kill her.\n",

      "The applicant was raised in a secular, middle-class family. Her parents instilled in her the desire to study and achieve, as well as to serve her country and those less fortunate. Prior to the Islamic Revolution, in 1975, she attended medical school. In 1979 the school was closed amidst the revolutionary turmoil. Islamic extremists soon consolidated power and imposed repressive measures aimed at women, including a strict dress code, barring women from many occupations, and the lowering to 9 the age of consent to marriage for females. As a Moslem she opposes these interpretations of Islam, and she was mistreated in Iran due to her differing religious beliefs. \"Islamic Societies\" were established by the regime in every hospital, government office and school, and given wide authority to monitor every aspect of people's lives. The groups monitored compliance with the dress code and participation in prayers. She began to wear a scarf because she was committed to finishing her medical education. Because of this dress code, for the first time she felt ashamed of being a woman, and she grew resentful of the regime. She worked in a hospital treating wounded from the Iran-Iraq war. She was horrified by the suffering. She was offended and humiliated by the fact that the Islamic authorities did not care about her skills or the quality of her care but only her compliance with the dress code. After graduating from medical school in 1982, she chose to practice in obstetrics and gynecology. The regime was busy segregating the professions and she was concerned there would not be enough women doctors to serve Iran's female population. She completed her residency in 1987 and worked as a doctor from 1987-92. During this period she was the victim of harassment, intimidation, inhuman treatment and insults from agents of the government. She was known not to be a supporter because she declined to participate in group prayers or government rallies and refused to wear the official black chador. The hospital's Islamic Society harassed her and watched her closely. She was reprimanded for failure to properly cover her hair; and her automobile was vandalized. She was subject to harassment and discrimination as a single woman. Married physicians were given housing near the hospital, but she was allotted a room in a hotel far away. Traveling to and from work was dangerous due to the war, and she was forced to sleep on a cot in a hospital hallway. She was turned down when she offered to share housing with nurses. Her complaints were rejected and she was told that she deserved it because she was single. The authorities at the hospital were all members of the Party of God (Hesbollah). They did not approve of a single woman working at the hospital. She was repeatedly confronted about her marital status and told to remarry, by which she understood they meant her to become a man's second or third wife. After a few years the hospital authorities contacted her father and told him that she was being transferred to another hospital because she was \"mad.\" Her father was told that living alone and single had caused his daughter to go insane. She was outraged and angry. At the second hospital she faced further difficulties. The staff refused to follow her directions. Staff members sought to undermine her work. Outside of work she was subjected to humiliating treatment because she failed to strictly comply with the dress code. She also heard about acid being thrown on women for such violations, and of the government slogan, \"either a scarf on your head or a fist on your head.\" She felt helpless and knew that the consequences of her resistance could include disappearance or execution. She left the country.\n",

Girls are banned from attending school; women are not allowed to work, and discouraged even from leaving their homes. If they must be on the street, women should be accompanied by a male relative and must wear the traditional \"burqa\" dress covering them from head to toe. Women cannot visit a male doctor. Punishment for violations includes public flogging, imprisonment, and death by stoning for adultery. The streets are patrolled by religious zealots. Organizations that she worked with have been targeted, their offices looted; others have pulled out of the country. The Taliban are aware of her due to her profile as a feminist activist.

She fears persecution for her activism in support of gender equity. As an educated, working woman who is single at age 35, she has clearly rejected the traditional role proscribed for women by the Taliban. She fears persecution based on her religious beliefs, as she is opposed to the Taliban's draconian interpretation of Islamic law and religion. Her belief is that religion is personal, that Islam is protective of women¹s rights, and that the Taliban violates the Koran with its interpretations and its cruel punishments.

Gays and lesbians in Iran are viewed as criminals and/or deviants, labeled as \"ham jens baz,\" and are forced to deny their feelings and live undercover out of fear of execution by the government. She felt ashamed and guilty and thought she had a \"problem\" that would go away. A friendship that she had with a fellow student eventually became a sexual relationship. The couple had to struggle with the gender-specific regulations in Iran which require women to have special permission to travel alone or to stay in a hotel. She lived in constant fear of discovery and punishment, a fear which was realized when the woman's parents and then her own parents learned of her relationship. Their parents were very upset, told her she was \"dirty\" and \"sick,\" and threatened to inform the authorities. The official punishments include 100 lashes for the first conviction and death for the third. Her lover's parents had her committed to an institution which sought to \"cure\" her through shock therapy. Her lover had agreed to marry an Iranian man as a way of getting out of Iran to the United States; once she was there she separated from her husband. The applicant, meanwhile, was thrown out of her house by her mother -- who threatened to inform the authorities -- and she lived with a relative.

She knows that she can no longer be silent and submissive, and she fears that the authorities will execute her. She thinks it is likely that one or both families has denounced them to the authorities. She also fears persecution on account of her gender and feminist ideas.

Her rights to freedom of movement, speech and dress were all severely restricted by the government. She was stigmatized and harassed as an unmarried woman.

Finally, she fears persecution for refusing to practice Islam, a decision which is considered apostasy and is punishable by death. She is considered a Moslem by birth but does not practice. Her rejection of the religion is tied to the manner in which women are treated under the Islamic Republic.\n",

      "The applicant's marriage was arranged by her family when she was 17 years old. Her husband soon began to beat her, including throwing her out of the house in the middle of the night. Her husband is a member of the ruling Hezbollah Party, and shares the party's fundamentalist Islamic beliefs. He thinks that a woman should not work outside the home, speak with men, or leave the house without her husband's permission. She was raised by her mother to believe that women should have freedom and respect. She lost these freedoms when she became married. Her mother-in-law lived in the home and told her that she should see her husband as her \"second god.\" Her mother- in-law also forced her to go to mosque. When her mother-in-law saw that the applicant disagreed with her husband, she got her son a second wife. Her husband's government connections include a brother-in-law who was the local judge. As a result, she could not go to the police when he beat her. He also was friends with the Islamic police, known as \"Pasdars\" or \"Bassijis.\" The Pasdars would patrol the streets looking for women violating the dress codes, and beat or throw acid on those not in compliance. Vehicles would be pulled over to ensure that a woman was driving with a male relative. Although they are in charge of enforcing Islamic moral codes, the Pasdars themselves hired prostitutes and smoked opium, including at opium parties hosted by her husband in her own home. She received a scar when her husband threw a vase at her head. When she was eight months pregnant, she was knocked unconscious after he kicked her down the stairs. On another occasion she was knocked unconscious and left alone in her home. Her reports to the police went ignored. He often threw her out of the house, and she would live with her family. She never wanted to return, but her father forced her to go. In the early 1990s her husband married a teenaged girl and threw the applicant out of the house. This time he did not ask her back. Later, he divorced her, but he still threatens her and her family. Due to the physical and psychological abuse that affected her and her daughter, the applicant’s family arranged for her to leave Iran. She was put in touch with a friend; they met and agreed to marry. She then entered the United States on a K-1 visa, but he changed his mind after she came to the U.S. with her daughter. She would be subjected to abuse and disdain if returned to Iran as a divorced woman who has been in the U.S. Iranian assume that those who lived in the U.S. led an immoral life. She would be treated like a prostitute. Her contact with the U.S. would also lead her to being suspected of opposing the regime. Because the government embraces fundamentalist Islam, her views on the rights of women are opposed to the regime on both political and religious grounds. She is opposed to the strict rules regulating women's conduct in Iran. She does not want her daughter to have to grow up in such an environment. Her husband would probably succeed in his effort to gain custody over their daughter.\n",

      "The applicant first became aware of the patriarchal nature of Iranian society when, at age 10, she learned from her mother that her father had other wives. Although raised in a working class family, her mother was committed to seeking a better life for her daughters through education, and she graduated from high school and attended some college. The westernization of Iran under the Shah in the 1960s and 1970s led to a widespread adoption of western dress and attitudes, but without a corresponding effect on the society's traditional gender roles. At age 16 she became involved in a secret relationship with an older man who then physically and sexually abused her, including rape with foreign objects. He kept her from escape through her fear of discovery. After a failed suicide attempt she told her mother and charges were brought against the man, but he was merely fined and spent one month in jail. The oppression of women became formal and institutionalized with the Islamic revolution. Progressive laws were revoked and repressive rules imposed, such as mandatory veiling, restricted education and employment opportunities, and encouragement of polygamy. The classical music program she was attending was closed, ending her dream of a career in music. In 1981 she became involved in an opposition group through a friend. She wore the opposition clothes and attended group meetings. She and her friend were reported on by a neighbor and arrested and interrogated by the Comiteh. Her family's landlord evicted them as a result. She ceased her involvement after her friend was sentenced to 7 years in prison. She then attempted to fit into the role dictated for women in society and was surgically reconstructed as a virgin in order to be able to marry. She met a man whom she hoped would be open-minded as he had studied abroad. But he imposed strict Islamic rules on her and sought to control her behavior, forcing her to stop working and listening to her music. When her son was 3 months old she and her husband separated, and she eventually lost touch with her child due to the father's opposition, even though she had a court order for visitation. The judge told her to give up as she would in any event lose any rights when the child became 2 years old. Between 1986-1994 she was detained 5 times for failure to observe the dress code, and paid a fine to avoid whipping. She began to comply out of fear of harsher punishment. She faces the social stigma of being a divorced woman. Men can have 4 wives, but a divorced woman brings shame on her family and can be denied housing and employment. She lived with her mother and misrepresented her status in order to get work. She fears religious persecution because she will be prevented from practicing her interpretation of Islam. She does not accept that Islam requires gender-specific regulations or that women must be restricted in their work and education.\n",

      "The applicant is a widow with three daughters, who lived in Kabul until 1990. Her husband, brother and brother-in-law were killed in the late 1980s because they did not want to join the communist party. The applicant's husband was taken away from his store by members of Har. He has not been heard from since, and is presumed dead. Prior to this abduction, he was once taken away and tortured for two months, then released. Her brother-in-law was also abducted by the Har at about the same time and subsequently released, and her brother was abducted and killed by the Har. After her husband's disappearance, Har members often came around. Fearing for her own safety and that of her daughters, she fled to Pakistan with her brother-in-law, in 1990. She applied for and was denied refugee status in Pakistan, and came to the United States. The applicant fears that if she and her daughters are forced to return to Afghanistan, the Taliban will strip them of their basic human rights. The Taliban prohibit women from attending schools, working, leaving their homes unless they are in the company of a male relative and receiving care from most medical facilities. Women must cover themselves from head to toe when they are in public. If a woman breaks any of these rules, she is subject to punishment, including beatings, arrest and even death. If returned to Afghanistan, as a widow and with no other male relatives to rely on, the applicant faces the harshest persecution. She or her daughters would not be able to work to earn money to support themselves, leave their home to buy daily essentials such as food and/or obtain any medical care. Furthermore, the applicant's daughters would not be allowed to continue their education and pursue their careers.\n",

The FMLN took over her entire neighborhood for some 8 days. A group of about a dozen guerrillas camped out in the family's back yard. She supplied them with the food that they demanded during this period. She was afraid, because she knew that the army would be angry that she was helping the FMLN, but they were armed, and she was powerless to do anything about it. When the guerrillas moved out of the neighborhood, one of them ordered her to accompany him. He threatened her family with harm if she did not obey. She was abducted and held for four days, during which time the guerrilla raped her several times. She was terrified and afraid for her family, and managed to escape. She returned home, and the entire family then went to live with other family members, because the guerrillas knew where they lived. In mid-1990 they returned to their home. Not long thereafter, the guerrilla who had abducted and raped her appeared at the house armed with a gun and demanded that she come with him. She refused, and he threatened to make her \"disappear.\" He said he would kill her if she told anybody about him. She was terrified, and spoke to her husband. The guerrilla returned twice more, and threatened to abduct her husband. She did not report the threat to the authorities, out of fear of revenge if she did so. The guerrillas are powerful in El Salvador, and the government cannot protect people from them. She believed his threat to kill her, and she knew that he was capable of abducting her because he had done so once already. She and her husband decided that they had to flee.

She became very frightened about being returned to Iran. Her fears intensified the more she learned about Iran, and eventually she attempted suicide in 1995. She fears she will be alienated from Iranian society and unable to conform her behavior to what will be expected of her. She fears persecution for her political opinion. She grew up in a tolerant society which is respectful of basic freedoms. She is used to having and expressing her own opinions. She does not even necessarily comply with her father's wishes at home. If returned to Iran, she would refuse to comply with strict gender-based regulations, and would be punished severely as a result. She would speak out against unjust rules and encourage others to do the same. She grew up believing in equal rights for girls and women. She is involved in competitive sports in school and is interested in a career in graphic design. Her educational and work opportunities would be restricted in Iran. The religious authorities in Iran believe that a woman's primary role is to be a wife and a mother. Those who oppose their restrictions based on gender are punished. The government identifies what it considers victims of \"westoxication\" and considers them to be anti-government. Having been raised in the U.S., she knows little about Iranian culture, cannot read or write Farsi, and is not a practicing Moslem. These facts have shaped her personality. She did not learn Farsi in school and thus could not continue her education in Iran. She would be socially unacceptable as she knows nothing about Islam. The restrictions and discrimination against those viewed as \"westoxicants\" amount to persecution. She has never worn a veil and considers the concept offensive and demeaning. She would refuse to wear one, and would be punished. She is accustomed to dressing like her peers. Requiring her to change her dress and demeanor would destroy her self- esteem and confidence. She has grown up interacting with both boys and girls, and has friends of both sexes. In Iran, the government forbids girls to look at or speak to boys. She would not be able to comply with these restrictions. The cumulative stress of dealing with being returned to Iran might cause her to again attempt suicide.

      "The applicant came to the United States as a student in March 1986. In 1990, she became attracted to another woman and their close friendship evolved into a lesbian relationship. This brought her to realize that she had always been attracted to women as she grew up in Iran. She recalls reading in the fifth grade about the execution of a lesbian couple in Iran, and that derogatory terms were used -- gay men were called \"coonie\" and lesbians were referred to as \"baroonie.\" Gay men were branded as child molesters. She realized that she had suppressed her feelings because of the harsh consequences awaiting lesbians in Iran. She fears that she faces torture and execution in Iran due to her sexual orientation. After living in the U.S. since 1986, she knows that she could not be silent and would resist the regime's repression aimed at gays and lesbians. Under Iranian law, lesbians are punished with 100 lashes for their first offense, and execution for their third offense. She also fears mistreatment in Iran on account of her gender and feminist ideas. She would be forced to adopt an offensive and demeaning lifestyle under the gender-specific regulations in place in Iran. Her rights to travel, free speech and dress would be severely restricted. She would be stigmatized and harassed for remaining unmarried, and for rejecting the traditional lifestyle approved by the Islamic Republic. She would be unable to practice her chosen career and would face gender discrimination. She would be unable to accept repressive laws governing women and family life, and would face severe punishment for this action. She is committed to her independence, accustomed to making her own decisions and unwilling to compromise her principles. She fears religious persecution for her refusal to practice Islam, a decision which is considered apostasy and is punishable by death. She has rejected Islam because it officially sanctions the mistreatment of women, and has joined the Unitarian Church. Her self-esteem and dignity would be destroyed by the gender regulations and the mistreatment of women in Iran. She fears that she would commit suicide rather than submit. She cannot accept that a woman's testimony is accorded half the weight of a man's; that people who oppose the government are killed; that teenagers who date prior to marriage are stoned to death; that a woman's brain is considered smaller than a man's; that she would have to live under the protection of a male family member to avoid the dishonor attached to women who live alone.\n",

Her father was taken and tortured there as well. Not long after, the applicant was attending a peaceful protest and the police raided it with tear gas and weapons. The applicant was again taken to the torture center, where she was kept locked in a very crowded cell for seven days, and was given no room to sleep, a functioning toilet or edible food. Each time the police interrogated her, they stripped her naked, beat her, sexually molested her and threatened to rape her. The applicant began organizing political plays that critiqued the government. The police raided the performances, spraying people with tear gas, beating them randomly and one time shooting to death a 12 year old girl whom the applicant was running hand-in-hand with. The applicant also worked for the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) with Dr. Richard Leakey. The government was at odds with the organization and wanted financial information and so they terrorized the applicant in their attempt to obtain that information. Immediately after Dr. Leakey was forced to resign, numerous men wearing masks and carrying guns, raided the applicant's family home.

Shortly after, three armed men identifying themselves as governmental authorities came to the applicant's new home.

One day, four armed men and her friend abducted the applicant. They drove her to a house and then inside they started beating her. They still were demanding information related to her work. They threatened to kill her children, cut her arm with a knife and gang-raped her. When she came to, five days had passed and she was in a hospital. She did not file an official police report because she was afraid the Sendero Luminoso would find out and retaliate. She and her children moved in with her father and left the country after they found out some men had come to her neighborhood looking for her.\n",

      "All the men in the applicant's family were guerrillas. When the applicant was 10 years old, her mother took her to Nicaragua to avoid the dangers of the war in El Salvador. When they returned, her brother and a cousin were political prisoners and her other brother had become a guerrilla commander. Because of her family's guerrilla connections, the inhabitants of their town, including the many military families that resided there, shouted insults at her and accused her of being a guerrilla. During this time, her brother and other guerrilla members would periodically descend from their mountain base and stay in the applicant's family's home. The applicant began a relationship with a guerrilla and became pregnant. Her father refused to let them marry, but they continued their relationship and the applicant eventually became pregnant again. One day eight to ten masked, armed soldiers came to her family's house looking for her brother. They beat the applicant and her friend, a pregnant guerrilla, and then gang-raped them. The applicant became pregnant as a result of the rapes. The applicant moved to another town, but had nightmares all the time. She returned to her family home, but soon after, approximately eight masked, armed soldiers came to the house, demanding information about the guerrillas. They snatched the applicant's newborn baby boy out of her arms, hit her in the head until she passed out and then gang-raped her. The soldiers took her baby and she has never seen him again. She became pregnant again as the result of these rapes, but miscarried four months later. She moved a few times and then fought as a guerrilla during the offensive of 1989. But when her brother was killed, she ceased her guerrilla activities and returned home. The applicant tried to build a life for herself, but after the peace accords, she learned that ex-soldiers were targeting her for her guerrilla activities. She then fled El Salvador.\n",

      "The applicant’s family supported, but did not belong to, the guerrilla movement. Her father worked in agriculture and cattle. She and other family members attended meetings for guerrilla supporters, read books written by progressive priests, marched in rallies and listened to Archbishop Romero on the radio. In 1980 the army invaded the applicant's town looking for guerrilla supporters. The soldiers burned houses, destroyed land, slaughtered animals, raped women, and killed people. The applicant and her family fled to the mountains. After they thought the army had left, the applicant's father returned to town. The soldiers were still there and they shot her father dead. When the applicant heard the news, she went to town to see for herself. However, on her way to town, she was intercepted by two armed soldiers. She knew them from her childhood; they were boys from the neighboring town. They beat her and then gang-raped her. The applicant, her mother and brothers fled to Honduras the next day by making the dangerous crossing of the Lempa River. For the next six years, the applicant and her family lived in a United Nations refugee camp. During those six years, the applicant had three daughters with her future husband. Her pregnancies were very difficult and one daughter even died. She thinks the complications were due to the rape. In 1988, after the UN and the church negotiated an amnesty with the Salvadoran government and the camps closed, her family returned to El Salvador. They moved to another town. Her husband returned to Honduras to be with his sister, his only family member that was not killed by the Salvadoran army. Although the Peace Accords were signed in 1992, the violence did not end. The ex-soldiers were now part of the death squads. One day the applicant saw the two ex-soldiers who raped her on a bus. They threatened to find out where she lived and hurt her. Following that incident, the applicant was so afraid that she stayed at home. Six months later, she left for the U.S. The applicant's neighbor reports that the ex-soldiers who raped her have asked about her whereabouts.\n",

      "The applicant was circumcised as a young girl, and recalls the pain of the process. She married at the age of 18 or 19; shortly thereafter, her husband became abusive. After she had their first child, he required that she be re-infibulated. This traditional practice is not performed in a hospital. She suffered internal bleeding and other complications and sought medical help. She was told that she may never be able to have another child. Her husband's reaction was to get a mistress. The people of the village in which they lived supported him. The father's family insisted that her daughter be circumcised. She attempted to oppose this, and faced retribution including physical abuse from her husband. She filed for divorce. Divorce cases are first sent to a family council made up of elders within the community for attempted reconciliation. The council did not accept her claim based on opposition to FGM and told her husband to try not to hit her again. The council also decided that her child should be given to his parents to be raised \"properly\"; she had no choice but to accept their decision. The child was taken and circumcised. Later, the girl escaped, changed her name, and eventually came to the United States as a refugee. Some fifteen years later she again became pregnant. Due to scarring from her infibullation, severe cutting had to be done in order to allow baby to be born. She was extremely sick and weak, with heavy bleeding, and almost did not survive. Nevertheless, her husband again required re-infibulation, and she complied. Because the applicant was so sick, her child was not taken away to be circumcised. She came to the U.S. to visit her sister, and sought asylum. She was reunited with her first child. The applicant fears that her husband would find her and rape her. Eritrea is a small country and she would be unable to hide from him; the authorities would not protect her. Should she again become pregnant, it is unlikely that she could survive another birth. Additionally, she fears that her child would be subjected to FGM, and that her attempt to oppose this would again lead to her losing her child.\n",

The applicant attended a public college that had many students who were members of the Sendero Luminoso rebel movement. The dorms in which she lived where predominantly occupied by Sendero Luminoso members who came from provinces with strong indigenous roots. There were only 14 “white” people at the school and they all socialized together since everyone else ostracized them. Many of the students insulted them by calling them “gringas” and “imperialists.” The applicant was an active member of the Popular Action political party, which was labeled as the “party for the rich” by the Sendero Luminoso. The applicant and her “white” roommate opened a campus office, however only about 15 people ever joined their party because of the strong presence of the Sendero Luminoso on campus. The applicant was regularly harassed and the party office was often vandalized. One night, two armed men came into her dorm room and forced her and her roommate to go outside, raise the Sendero Luminoso flag and sing revolutionary songs. Many people saw what was going on, but no one intervened. A few months later, ten hooded, armed men abducted the applicant and her roommate. They put hoods over their heads, threw them into a car and began to beat them. They stopped the car, continued to beat them and then the applicant felt a blow to her head and she passed out. She awoke in a small room with her roomate, both naked, and bleeding. Two men came into the room and dragged her roommate out of the room, and she has never seen her again.

Her boyfriend took her to a police medical clinic, where she learned that she had been brutally gang raped and required stitches.

After her father died, however, she found herself under the authority of her uncle. He seeks to arrange her marriage, and requires her to undergo FGM pursuant to tribal custom. Her uncle stands to gain a dowry in return for giving the applicant up for marriage. At one point, he nearly tricked the applicant into an FGM ceremony, but the event was postponed after the woman who was being cut prior to the applicant suffered complications, the woman later died. The applicant, through the help of her family and a pastor in the Presbyterian church, managed to escape to Nairobi and subsequently to the United States. The Kikuyu practice FGM with both cultural and political overtones. Culturally, the practice is a basic initiation into the tribe, and women who are not circumcised have difficulty finding marriage partners. Politically, the practice is linked to Kenyan nationalism as an historical assertion of independence against colonialism and the anti-circumcision campaigns conducted in Kenya by the former colonial power, Britain. Through correspondence with her brother, the applicant has learned that her uncle continues to look for her in Kenya, and he has confiscated property belonging to her mother in retaliation for her mother’s assistance in the applicant’s escape. The applicant notes that the police would not protect her because they leave FGM matters to the tribal elders.\n",

In schools, Midgans must sit in the back of room, do not get basic supplies such as books, and are treated poorly by other children and teachers alike.

The family and about ten neighborhood women beat the applicant so badly that she needed over a month to fully recuperate. The applicant could not get a job or even walk outside without being pointed or laughed at, because she had been named as a thief.

The family later learned that there had been a massacre nearby, and assumed he had been killed. That same day, Farah Aideed’s army came through the Midgan slum. Three or four armed men in uniforms broke into the applicant’s home and gang raped her and her mother. They said it did not matter how they treated Midgan women because they were not people.

Not until the pro-Soviet government came to power, however, was she able to pursue her education beyond high school. As a medical student in the 1980s she worked on issues relating to women and children. She became a strong advocate of family planning and advised women to use birth control and not to have more than three children. She felt that women could not otherwise participate in society. Some women agreed with her suggestions, but others did not. After the Soviet troops withdrew in 1989 she began to face difficulties on the streets of Kabul. After a female physician was badly burned by acid thrown on her she, for her own safety, wore a small veil. As a working woman advocating \"sinful\" ideas, she was advised by management at the clinic where she worked to exercise extreme caution. She may have avoided abduction on two occasions when suspicious individuals came to her home in the middle of the night citing a medical emergency. Following the mujahideen takeover in May 1992, all women were ordered to remain at home. Her clinic was closed down, but she continued working at a birthing center. A nurse she was acquainted with was abducted and raped on the street, and she heard many other similar stories. She treated a 13 year-old girl who was raped. She and her family finally left for Pakistan in September 1992, where she volunteered at a hospital. After confrontations with an Afghani woman physician who accused her of being a communist for working in Afghanistan during the 1980s, she opened a small clinic to serve Afghani refugees. The clinic received threats and was attacked several times, however, and she was warned to stop working. The Pakistani police assured her that she would be protected. But after two female physicians with nearby offices were assassinated in December 1995 she left for the U.S.\n",

She spent approximately five hours a day, talking to women in their home about the Party. Her husband beat her because he wanted her to stay at home. Her in-laws were also abusive towards her. The applicant never reported the abuse to the police, but she did flee her home on numerous occasions. One time she fled to her grandfather?s home, but her grandfather turned her over to her husband. On the last incident before she fled Bangladesh, she ran away from her husband and in-laws. She hid from them at her mother's home for five months, but since her mother was encouraging her to return to her husband, the applicant fled to the U.S. As a Muslim woman, the applicant could not file for divorce in Bangladesh.\n",

Eight months into their marriage, she was pregnant with their first child. In 4/90, the husband returned home intoxicated and beat her after accusing her of being unfaithful, breaking her nose and giving her two black eyes. Her husband did not allow her to leave the house for medical treatment, and he threatened to kill or \"disappear\" her. After two days, her husband went to work and she pressed abuse charges against him with the mayor and a judge. The husband was ordered to appear; she went to live with her parents. The husband did not obey the summons and was not pursued by the police. She rarely left her parents house due to fear of her husband. The husband refused to have himself listed as the father on his two children's birth certificates. She moved to Guatemala City to support herself working as a machine operator. Her husband, by then in the army, tracked her down. The couple briefly reconciled. Within two months, she was again pregnant and her husband was again threatening to kill her. She fled to her parents' home, but he followed her there and was seen around the house. The husband also threatened to kill her brother. A judge told her that there was nothing to be done because the police had not served him, and closed the case. The husband, no longer in the military, had relations with other women during this time. One woman who was beaten by him reported the incident to the police, but he was let go when he showed his military card. In 6/95, she fled Guatemala for the U.S., leaving her children in her parents' care.\n",

      "The applicant is from a secular Afghani family. Her father was a school principal who, while not a member of the communist party, supported the government's economic and social policies. The family did not support the Mujahideen because they were familiar with and opposed to their Islamic extremism. In 1986, the family moved to Kabul to escape the Mujahideen's growing activity in the provinces. She was not active in politics in order to concentrate on her education, but she had friends in the Communist Youth Organization, read their materials and occasionally helped with meetings and activities. She graduated high school in 1988 and attended Kabul University until 1991. In 1992, she began training in hospitals in Kabul, but was forced to stop that training as the streets became unsafe for non-veiled women and women working outside the home. Shortly thereafter, the Najibullah government collapsed. She did not wear a veil because it symbolized for her the submissive second-class status for women. She believes that women are entitled to an equal position in society, and she acted on that belief in seeking a career. The family made preparations to flee Kabul in the midst of the chaos of the change in regimes. They hid in their home, using no lights to make it appear vacant. In June and July 1992, members of the Mujahideen came and beat her brother and father while the women hid in the basement. Her father was accused of supporting the communists and teaching communist propaganda. On the second visit the Mujahideen asked about reports that there were women in the house who dressed like communists. Shortly thereafter, a young woman neighbor who had been studying at the university was abducted and killed. Three days later, the family fled for India through Pakistan, using disguises. They had no permanent permission to remain in India and were concerned about being returned to Afghanistan. The situation for educated and secular women in Afghanistan has only deteriorated since she left the country.\n",

She is opposed to the present government. As a teacher and school director, she believed in teaching children freedom of thought and expression. The applicant claims that radical members of the mujahideen groups led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Abdurrab Rasul wanted her to teach the children ?only to go along and cooperate with the radical leaders.? Because she would not cooperate she was on a list of ?dangerous people.? The applicant states that she has been threatened at gunpoint regarding the running of the school and to provide names of friends. In the 1990s she was arrested and held in a cell in the office of the Minister of the Interior for 30 days. She was never charged but she was beaten, and she was interrogated every few days about her political and social activities. While living with her parents in Kabul, their house was hit by a firebomb. She and her husband and their children fled to India to escape radical mujahideen forces that were after her. They left India when members of the mujahideen tracked her down and tried to abduct her in a market. She is afraid that if she returns to Afghanistan she will be captured, tortured, or executed because of her political opinions and because she does not believe in radical fundamental Islamic law.\n",

Because they lived and worked for this man, the applicant’s family supported the government and voted for the conservative ARENA party. Two of her brothers and three of her cousins served in the army. The guerrillas started coming to the plantation and to their homes in 1981, asking them to quit working and demanding food and money. The first time the guerrillas came to the applicant's house during the night, they beat her husband, forced her to chop down a lamp post, beat her and gang-raped her in the street. She reported the incident to the military, but the guerrillas were already in hiding. The applicant's husband blamed her for the rape. The second time the guerrillas came to the applicant's house, they forced her to carry 50 pounds of gunpowder to their camp even though she was four months pregnant. At the camp, the guerrillas beat her and six men raped her. Once again, her husband blamed her for the rape and problems between them ensued. In the third incident, the guerrillas forced her to carry heavy sacks to their camp. They shot and killed three men who had family members in the military. They again threatened her, beat her and gang-raped her. This time the applicant did not report the incident to the military because no action was taken the first two times and it only made the guerrillas more angry at her. The applicant's husband then fled El Salvador because he feared the guerrillas and there were many marital problems due to her rapes. In the fourth incident, the guerrillas made her carry heavy sacks to their camp, cook for them, and serve as a guard. They again gang-raped her. She could no longer go to the doctor for medicine because after her husband left she was very poor. Eventually though, at age 29, she had to have her uterus removed because of all the trauma caused by the rapes. The fifth incident occurred after the Peace Accords; five guerrillas tied up her children, took her from her house and gang-raped her. After this last incident, the applicant finally fled El Salvador.\n",

She supported the regime because of its steps to improve the situation for Afghani women. The government encouraged women to attend school, to work outside the home, and to engage in active roles in society. The government sought to eradicate discrimination against women. As part of her literacy and health courses, she taught women about birth control, about the importance of education their children, and in some cases how to end an unwanted pregnancy. She discussed the political situation, as Islamic fundamentalists were targeting the class and warning women not to attend. She told the women not to support the Mujahideen, that the Mujahideen did not support equality for women and that they would impose strict restrictions on women. She told the women that the accusation that the government was desecrating the Koran was not true. In December 1988 a bomb exploded in her office. Three co-workers were killed, and she developed a nervous condition causing her to stutter. In January 1989 a man threatened her with a gun outside of one of her literacy classes. The next night she received a death threat at home, warning her not to return to work. With the help of her office, she obtained a passport and fled the country.

The newsletter emerged from secret publication after the shah fell from office, and began also calling for unionization and improved working conditions for women. By mid-1979, the situation for women in Iran began to worsen. A dress code was established requiring women to wear the \"hejab.\" She organized a march and rally in opposition to the new rules in a major Iranian city. She was attacked, beaten and cursed while speaking at the rally. Because the Islamic fundamentalists had not yet consolidated their hold on power, she was not arrested. The group intensified its opposition, but had to resume clandestine publication of the newsletter after the government cracked down on newspapers. By mid-1981 she was in hiding to avoid arrest. The newsletter continued to oppose the regime, including the Iran-Iraq War. In mid-1982 the government authorities came to her home with an arrest warrant; she was not there but still in hiding.

She was harassed, intimidated and threatened, and her mother was threatened. She knew that she would be imprisoned if she did not sign the statement. Her passport was returned and she returned to Italy. Outraged over her treatment, she redoubled her efforts to oppose the regime, knowing that she would not be able to return. Steps were taken to restrict her activities, with the usual annual passport renewal being limited to every three months for her and her husband. Every three months she had to report to the Iranian consulate for renewal of her passport, where she would be harassed and threatened.

      "The applicant left Afghanistan for Pakistan with her parents and siblings in November 1984 out of fear that the communist authorities would arrest them for refusing to join the party and for opposing the regime. The communist authorities had sought their cooperation as they were all educated members of society. She received medical training working with a doctor in Pakistan, and beginning in 1986 she worked at a women's clinic there as a pharmacist. She was forced to stop working at the clinic in 1987 due to threats from Islamic extremists. Although she and other women wore Islamic clothing, the extremists were not pleased with women working outside the home. She received letters telling the women working at the clinic to stop treating Afghani women and threatening them with death if they did not stop their work. They were accused with encouraging Moslem women to leave their homes and of setting a bad example. The clinics driver was attacked and beaten. She then worked until late 1990 at another clinic, along with other Afghani women. Her female patients often complained of problems related to repeated pregnancies and complications during childbirth, and she dispensed birth control pills and explained their use. She encouraged the female patients to send their children to school and to learn skills themselves. She helped with a literacy class, which discussed birth control, hygiene, child development and self-reliance. She sought to instill a level of consciousness in Afghani women that she interacted with. She and her husband were members of the Afghani National Front organization, Jabha-yi-Najat-Melli. Her husband brought home literature, and she shared her ideas with women that she worked with. The National Front sought a peaceful political resolution to the conflict, but the Islamic fundamentalist groups wanted to continue fighting. Islamic extremists, particularly Hesb-e-Islami, were opposed to Afghani women working outside their homes or with foreigners. They believed that they were corrupting women. The van that took the women to work at the clinic was surrounded by angry crowds and stopped several times, and threatening letters were sent to her home and to the clinic. In June 1990 the clinic was attacked by the fundamentalists; windows were broken and a security guard fired a weapon to disperse the crowd. The crowd went and attacked another clinic. The clinic was closed for a week. After that, the director told her that it was too dangerous for her to work as a pharmacist and he hired her as a secretary. In November 1990 she left the clinic as it was too dangerous to continue. OIn January 1991 her husband was killed on a mission for the National Front in confrontation with the Mujahideen. She was one month pregnant at the time. A few months later, she recovered from the resulting depression and began teaching National Front literacy classes as a volunteer. Again, she shared her views on birth control, women and the family, and she discussed and supported the National Front's ideas. Once her child was born she stopped attending the literacy classes as she became more concerned with her personal security. Attacks on moderate Afghans had increased. Because her political views and views on women were known to the fundamentalists, she decided to leave Pakistan.\n",

      "The applicants are a family: a mother, her two adult daughters, and a 10 year-old male child. While in Afghanistan, the family sent the daughters to school. One daughter studied nursery and midwifery and was employed as a nurse at Children's Hospital in Kabul. When the communist People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) came to power in 1979, employees were expected to become party members, and employees were assumed by people on the outsider to be members of the party. However, the daughter did not join the PDPA, despite pressure to do so. She eventually quit her position in late 1989 due to ongoing harassment by party members. The family was harassed at their home by communist party members. One son fled the country in 1983 out of fear of imprisonment; in the mid-1980s, the father was arrested at his store, and his family has not heard from him since. The family home was often visited by soldiers looking for the two men. Following the father's disappearance and fearing ongoing harassment from the communists, the three women and an infant fled Afghanistan in December 1989. In April 1992 a coalition of mujahideen groups seized power in Afghanistan and imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law. Women are denied education, careers, reproductive choices, and the right to vote or even drive. Women are subject to strict moral codes including dress codes. Families face death for educating their daughters; young unmarried women face rape and death by local gunmen. The regime persecutes its opponents, including those presumed to have been communists or supported the communists. The applicants fear persecution based on an imputed political opinion of opposition due to their high education levels and the daughter's employment in a communist-run hospital. They also fear persecution due to their opposition to the harsh gender-specific regulations.\n",

She studied at Kabul University and wore western clothes. As a result, leaflets were left at the family home warning her to stop attending school and to obey the mujahideen's strict rules regarding the appropriate role for women in society. If sent back to Afghanistan she would have to comply with these rules, including the wearing of a veil from head to toe. She could not wear this veil as it symbolizes to her oppression, submission and lack of freedom. As a result, she would face prison and other punishments. She would also not be allowed to further her education, to work outside of the home, or even to leave her home without a male relative. She has no male relatives in Afghanistan and would thus be unable to support herself and would be a prisoner in her home. In 1987 she left for India.

      "The applicant worked at a public relations firm that worked on government political campaigns. In her spare time, she volunteered at a soup kitchen in a poor area. Later she learned that members of Sendero Luminoso were at the soup kitchen. Soon after she started volunteering, she got frequent phone calls from people identifying themselves as Sendero Luminoso members who asked her to collaborate with them. They wanted information about the company, but she always refused. People started coming to their home, ringing the doorbell in the middle of the night. The applicant filed a report with the police, but the police said they could not do anything because no one had been hurt. Terrified, she and her husband ceased all of their leisure activities and took their daughter out of school. One day, three or four armed men wearing hoods kidnapped the applicant and her husband. They blindfolded them, beat the applicant’s husband and hit her. The men mentioned Comrade Gonzalo and chanted slogans. They took the couple to an abandoned house where they asked the applicant for information about her company and told her that they wanted to enlist her into their cause. When she refused, they gang-raped her in front of her husband. They said that unless she cooperated, they would kill her husband. The armed men left the house and the applicant and her husband managed to get to the closest police station. They filed an official report and the applicant recently found out that several people were arrested for her rape. After the incident, the applicant and her husband quit their jobs, moved in with her parents and eventually left Peru.\n",

After attending secular, co-ed schools in Iran, she came to the U.S. as a college student and remained here to pursue her professional career. Since her arrival to the U.S. she has only returned to Iran twice, for short periods of time. The applicant is opposed to a theocracy and to the gender-specific regulations and practices in Iran, which she believes violate women’s human rights.

She believes that she and her daughters should have the right to interact with both sexes, but in Iran there is strict gender segregation that severe limits males and females ability to interact socially. The applicant opposes all of the gender-segregated laws because of the legal, medical and economically detrimental affects that they have on women. She fears that she would be punished for behaving in ways that she has become accustomed to in the U.S. Simple acts, such as smiling at a man on the street or wearing make-up, can result in arrest, lashing and imprisonment. She would not be able to perform her job because as a married woman she is not allowed to work and travel on business trips.

She believes in God but does not observe any of the practices associated with Islam. In Iran, those who fail to practice Islam are considered heretics and those who reject the religion are punishable with death.\n",

Her father has taken many stands against the corruption of the Siad Barre and Mohamed Egal regimes and therefore he and his family, including the applicant, have been targeted for persecution. After his military coup, President Siad imprisoned her father for seven years due to his work for the former government; years later, President Egal ordered his assassination since he criticized his government. During her father's imprisonment, the applicant's family lived in constant fear. When the applicant refused to sing the national anthem honoring Siad Barre, her defiance was reported to the National Security Service and two officers detained her, interrogated her and beat her. She was warned that she would be raped if she did not escape or comply with the officers' orders. She was released after three days. The applicant continued her education even though there was a widespread belief in the country that women did not need an education. She studied in India and in England, where she married. She returned to Somalia in 1981, but the civil broke out soon after. The applicant and her son left the country to join her husband because the president ordered arial bombardments, home searches and execution of Isaak men, women and children. Her brother, father, uncle and cousin were captured and imprisoned for a year. In 1991, Somaliland became independent and her father joined the government, then resigned to protest the corrupt practices was denounced as a traitor by the president. Meanwhile, the applicant's husband was drinking heavily, staying away from home and having affairs. The applicant eventually filed for divorce - a highly unusual step for a woman - and the court made her relinquish custody of her children to her husband and return home. Back in Somaliland, the applicant co-founded a women's organization to help women achieve emotional, financial, and social independence. The government told her that her organization was subversive and unlawful and threatened her with arrest, jail and even execution. The applicant's father urged the applicant to leave Somaliland since he knew the applicant would not cease her activism. The other women involved with the women's organization left the country as well. Several of the applicant's siblings have also fled Somaliland and received asylum in other countries. Since her departure from Somaliland, President Egal ordered the assassination of her father and Egal's soldiers have harassed her brothers at gunpoint.\n",

As a woman living alone, the applicant was subjected to progressively severe harassment, verbal and physical threats and physical abuse. Particularly following the election of Benazir Bhutto as Prime Minister in 1988, there was an increasingly hostile climate against women, with increasing acts of violence, terrorism, lawlessness and political turmoil. Much of this turmoil is directed at women, particularly those living alone without a male head of household. The instigators were generally conservative Shi'ite groups that wish to keep Pakistan a strict, Islamic state with subordinate roles for women. In the apartment building where the applicant lived, two other married women also lived alone, without their husband. All three women were routinely subjected to threats, accusations of infidelity, and were sexually propositioned by males living in the building. She was terrified by the accusations of infidelity, which could lead to criminal prosecution. Neighbors grew bolder over the years, verbally insulting and propositioning her in the halls. Excrement was smeared on her door; neighborhood children threw rocks at her. In September 1990, gunshots were fired into her apartment. The applicant lived in terror as the situation in Pakistan worsened in the early 1990s. In 1992, she obtained a visa to come to the U.S. The applicant was without recourse to the police to complain about her neighbors' abuse, as she feared that she would herself by arrested and investigated for making such a complaint, if not jailed and raped.\n",

She remembers the extremely painful procedure and continues to suffer from the physical pain as well as the emotional scars of FGM up until today. In 1976, the applicant's elders arranged her to marry; the man who was chosen had strong political ambitions. The couple had two daughters but were eventually divorced. The applicant earned a medical degree and then came to the U.S. to earn a Master's in Public Health. In the U.S., the applicant became a public, outspoken advocate against FGM, earning the attention and praise of other advocates and the media. However, her work against FGM has compromised her daughters' safety in Africa. Thus far, the applicant has successfully prevented both her daughters from having to undergo FGM. The applicant has removed her eldest daughter from her country, but her younger daughter is still there. The applicant fears that her ex-husband will forcibly subject their daughters to the ritual because he strongly believes in FGM and as a punishment for her anti-FGM activities. The applicant's ex-husband has said that he is determined to bring about her demise by his hands. Furthermore, authorities in the applicant's country are aware of her anti-FGM activities and feel that she has \"overstepped her boundaries\".\n",

She traveled to Pakistan where she remained until 1994, when it became unsafe for a secular Afghani woman to live. She traveled between Tashkent and Dubai until she could get a visa to the United States, where all of her closest relatives are legal residents. The situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated since she left. The Taliban has seized control of the country and, using Islam as a pretext, has implemented strict gender- based laws and regulations. Women are forbidden to work outside the home or to attend school. Women are required to wear the \"burqa\" in public, a head-to-toe covering with slits for the eyes. Male doctors cannot treat female patients. Criminal punishments include death by stoning. She would not be able to live under such a regime. She finds these draconian gender-based regulations offensive and she would not be able to conform to them.\n",

      "The applicant was born in Teheran to a professional couple (her father was an engineer working for the government; her mother a teacher). The educated women in the family served as strong role models. The revolution began when the applicant was in high school in Teheran. She returned to the home outside of the capital as violence broke out. She faced hardship and shortages during the revolutionary period and Iran-Iraq war. Strict new dress codes were put in place in schools, as well as segregation by sex. She was no longer able to speak with her male school friends, and was forced to break off a friendship with a Bahaii girl. The applicant hated the dress code as she felt that she was living a lie in public, where her behavior was totally different to that when she was in private with friends and family. She entered Teheran University after scoring high on the national exams. Her classmates warned her not to wear Western clothes or to laugh out loud. She could be written up by the authorities for failing to cover her hair or to pray as directed. The applicant was involved with the swim team but her father was never permitted to watch the women compete. The university's Islamic Committee members would mingle with students and report on violations, and even call a woman at home to see if she would speak with a man she did not know. The applicant disagreed with the Islamic Committee's interpretation of the Muslim faith. The applicant had a few interactions with members of the opposite sex, but they were always limited to phone calls or a single date due to anxiety over observation or detection by revolutionary guards. A young man who spoke with her sister on a hike was beaten by a guard, and her sister was forced to sign a promise never to speak to him again. The severe limitations on the applicant became even more evident when she began her rotations as a doctor. She was forced to conduct her examinations through traditional clothes, and she faced rejection as a woman doctor from her patients. Her concerns over the quality of the health care were rejected. She became depressed and visited a psychiatrist. Rather than be sent to do the required medical work in a remote area, the applicant traveled with her father to Holland on a business trip, where she met her cousin. She experienced for the first time getting to know a man in an atmosphere of freedom. They attempted to marry, but decided that he would return to the U.S. and get the paperwork going for a visa for her to come as his wife. The applicant was concerned about abandoning her medical schooling, but knew she could not live freely or without fear in Iran. At this time, she was involved in several incidents with Islamic guards who sought to enforce their restrictive rules. Knowing she was to leave, she would talk back. (Shortly after she left, her parents received a report about a violation of Islamic rules by the applicant when she was seen driving the family car without her hair covered and wearing makeup. Her parents had to appear in her stead; they were forced to apologize and were humiliated by a mullah.) The applicant left for the U.S. and spent time there with her cousin. Not long afterwards, however, she discovered that her cousin had decided not to marry her and was seeing somebody else. She was now no longer a virgin, and would not be able to return to Iran and marry another man. She feared that this fact would become known by the Islamic guards. Her sister has recently been arrested by the guards when going to a coffee house with a male friend.\n",
